# NaturewatchCamUI
This is the web interface for the Naturewatch Camera. It interacts with the [NaturewatchCamServer](https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/NaturewatchCameraServer) to control various settings on the camera, stop and start recording, and to view and delete the photos captured.

## Installation
Place this script in the `/var/www/html/` directory of Apache on the Raspberry Pi. An Apache port configurations also needs to be created so that the JS can access the NaturewatchCamServer on port 9090.

## Issues
Please report issues with the interface here. Anything else related to the camera software itself, or the Raspberry Pi setup, should be reported [here](https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/NaturewatchCameraServer).
